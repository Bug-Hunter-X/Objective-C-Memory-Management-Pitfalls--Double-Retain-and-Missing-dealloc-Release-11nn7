# Objective-C Memory Management Pitfalls

This repository demonstrates a common error in Objective-C memory management involving double retaining of properties and forgetting to release objects in `dealloc`.  Understanding this is crucial for writing stable and efficient Objective-C applications, especially when working with legacy code.

## Bug Description

The `bug.m` file contains code where a property using `retain` is manually allocated and assigned, leading to a double retain and memory leak.  Additionally, the necessary release in the `dealloc` method is omitted, further contributing to the problem.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.m` file corrects these issues.  It properly handles memory management by avoiding manual allocation and ensuring proper release of the property in the `dealloc` method.  This showcases best practices for memory management in Objective-C.

## Note

In modern Objective-C with Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), this manual memory management is unnecessary, but understanding these principles remains essential for legacy code and grasping low-level memory management concepts.
